## Interests in Urban Planning
* Sustainability
* Transportation
* Accessibility
* Aging populations
## What I would like to get out of the course
I have long been interested in using GIS to better understand spatial issues of urban planning, but I have no technical background using it. I would like to become somewhat comfortable using python and gain a grasp of spatial data science as a way to communicate system processes, demographic information, and other attributes of geographic space and time.
## Project Ideas
Mande language distribution in Senegambia region
